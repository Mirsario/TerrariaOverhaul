# üî• What's this?
Terraria Overhaul is a *huuuge* game mechanics changing mod for Terraria.
You can read more about it at [this forum page](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/.60369/) (Might be outdated.)

# ‚åö What's the state of the rebuild?
This version is around 60%+ done.
It's missing many features from the 1.3 version, but what's currently implemented is much superior to the old versions.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How do I build this?

Below is a step by step instruction for that. It only assumes that you know at least how to use command prompts, shells, or terminals. You should.

- Get [TModLoader from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/).
- Clone the mod's 1.4 branch into `%userprofile%/Documents/My games/Terraria/tModLoader/ModSources`.
The git command for that would be `git clone https://github.com/Mirsario/TerrariaOverhaul -b 1.4`.
- Head over to Mod Sources in-game and `Build & Reload` TerrariaOverhaul.

That's all. Use `git fetch` and `git pull` to keep up with updates. Note that you'll need to rerun patching in the tML setup tool when updating tML.
