- A vastly superior & open sourced codebase;
- Reimagined and more vanilla-faithful, while also more crazy, solid and fun game design;
- Magnitudes more overall quality assurance & polishing.
- Near flawless compatibility with content mods, to be polished further soon.

[b]How do I configure the mod?[/b]
[quote]If clicking 'Configuration' in top left of main menu doesn't help you - Head over to the following path:
[b]On Windows:[/b] [i][u]%userprofile%/Documents/My games/Terraria/tModLoader/TerrariaOverhaul[/u][/i]
[b]On Linux:[/b] [i][u]~/.local/share/Terraria/tModLoader/TerrariaOverhaul[/u][/i]
[b]On MacOS:[/b] [i][u]~/Library/Application support/Terraria/tModLoader/TerrariaOverhaul[/u][/i]
(Where [i][u]tModLoader[/u][/i] may be [i][u]tModLoader-preview[/u][/i] if you're using a preview TML version.)
and manually edit the [i][u]Config.json[/u][/i] file. Overhaul will automatically import configuration when it's saved.

Work is currently being done towards having a rich in-game configuration screen.
